# Conway's Game of Life in Pandas

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pandas.

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules. This notebook will simulate the game using Pandas DataFrames to represent the cells. 

- Initialize a grid with a simple demo pattern.
- Implement the rules of the game using loops.
- Simulate the evolution of the grid over multiple steps.
- Display the grid's state at each step to create an animation effect.
